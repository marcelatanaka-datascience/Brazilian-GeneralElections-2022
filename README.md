# Brazilian General Elections Results

Hello there.
Welcome!

Here you'll find all the files from Brazil's 2022 General Elections.
The results were extracted from the TSE official website. Check it here: <a href="https://dadosabertos.tse.jus.br/dataset/resultados-2022" target="_blank">Tribunal Superior Eleitoral</a>

The goal here is to focus all the results in a single place, and, most importantly, share the code I used to do so.

I know it's not the most pythonian code as it is a little verbose and redundant, but... it works :)

Please, fell free to share contributions. PR's are welcome!
